<p>This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:</p>
<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>Will generate a <code>.html</code> page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate a <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with</p>
<p><code>bash
pip install typer markdown</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>bash
uv add typer markdown</code></p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you end up using any open-source frameworks/packages not covered in the course during your project? If so</strong>
<strong>which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used <strong>Loguru</strong> for structured logging with better formatting than Python's built-in logging module. </p>
<p>We used <strong>sentence-transformers</strong> from HuggingFace for pre-trained text embeddings, allowing us to quickly generate embeddings without fine-tuning. </p>
<p>We used <strong>nvitop</strong> for real-time GPU monitoring during training, displaying GPU utilization, temperature, memory, and power consumption in our custom progress bars. </p>
<p>We used <strong>PEFT</strong> (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) from HuggingFace for potential LoRA-based fine-tuning experiments. </p>
<p>Finally, we experimented <strong>Modal</strong> as an alternative cloud training platform, which provides serverless GPU compute with simple Python decorators for orchestrating remote training jobs, although we ran out of free credits fast ;(.</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>

<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use <strong>uv</strong> for package management. All dependencies are specified in <code>pyproject.toml</code> with exact versions locked in <code>uv.lock</code> for reproducibility. </p>
<p>We also have individual pytorch support for different hardware setups:. A new team member would first run:</p>
<p><code>bash
git clone https://github.com/nicholaseruplarsen/mlops-02476
cd mlops-02476</code></p>
<p>Then one of:
<code>bash
uv sync                         # pytorch-cpu for reduced size
uv sync --extra cuda            # NVIDIA GPUs
uv sync --extra rocm            # AMD GPUs on Linux</code>
Depending on their hardware, and then:
<code>bash
uv run dvc pull --no-run-cache</code>
To pull data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) (requires credentials ofc.)</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the cookiecutter template we filled out the <code>src/arxiv_classifier/</code> folder with our main application code including <code>data.py</code> for data loading and preprocessing, <code>train.py</code> for the training loop, <code>api.py</code> for the FastAPI inference service, and a <code>models/</code> subfolder containing <code>base.py</code>, <code>scibert.py</code>, and <code>sentence_transformer.py</code> for our model implementations. </p>
<p>We populated the <code>tests/</code> folder with unit tests for data, models, training, and API endpoints. We added a <code>configs/</code> folder with Hydra configuration files (<code>config.yaml</code> and <code>experiment/</code> subdirectory) which was not part of the original template. We also added a <code>dockerfiles/</code> folder containing <code>api.dockerfile</code> and <code>train.dockerfile</code> for containerization. The <code>.github/workflows/</code> folder was extended with CI/CD pipelines for testing, linting, and Docker builds. We kept the standard <code>data/</code> folder structure with <code>raw/</code> and <code>processed/</code> subdirectories managed by DVC.</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,</strong>
<strong>explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These</em>
<em>concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use <strong>Ruff</strong> for both linting and formatting, configured in <code>pyproject.toml</code> with a line length of 120 characters. Ruff checks are enforced in our CI pipeline via <code>.github/workflows/linting.yaml</code> which runs <code>ruff check</code> and <code>ruff format --check</code> on every push and pull request. We also use <strong>pre-commit hooks</strong> configured in <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> that run automatically before each commit, checking for trailing whitespace, ensuring files end with newlines, validating YAML syntax, and blocking large files (&gt;500KB). </p>
<p>For typing, we use Python type hints throughout our codebase, particularly in the API schemas (Pydantic models) and model interfaces. Documentation is provided through docstrings in key modules. These practices matter in larger projects because they ensure consistency across multiple contributors, catch errors early before they reach production, make the codebase more maintainable, and reduce cognitive load when reading unfamiliar code.</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In total we have implemented <strong>28 tests</strong> across 4 test files. </p>
<p>We have 2 tests in <code>test_data.py</code> verifying data loading and label validity across all splits. </p>
<p>We have 9 tests in <code>test_model.py</code> testing SciBERT and SentenceTransformer forward passes, predictions, layer freezing behavior, and the model registry. </p>
<p>We have 7 tests in <code>test_train.py</code> covering the text collation function, single training steps for both model types, model save/load, and gradient flow verification. </p>
<p>Finally, we have 10 tests in <code>test_api.py</code> testing our FastAPI endpoints including health checks, prediction validation, error handling, and edge cases.</p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
